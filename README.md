# Pet-project collection

This repository contains a collection of pet projects I have developed. Projects are written in different programming
languages and have different complexity. Projects are divided into modules, through which you can go to a separate
GitHub repository. Each project has its own README file with a description of the project and instructions for running
it.

## FAQ

### What have I learned while developing projects?

Since not many projects have been written yet, but it is planned to expand this project and turn it from pet projects
into a collection of projects that can be useful to other developers, I can say that I have learned a lot. I have
learned how to work with different technologies, how to write code in different programming languages, how to write
documentation, and how to work with GitHub.

### What global technologies would you like to teach?

I would like to know how different languages (both high-level and low-level) work at the kernel level, how their
interpreters/compilers work, how the build process works, and perhaps create my own simple and lightweight interpreter
and/or compiler.

If we look at the field of web development, I would like to learn in practice how to properly optimize databases for
large amounts of data, hone my skills in working with Docker, and learn how to work with Kubernetes and in general,
hone more skills in using different technologies (Next.js, C++, Python, etc.).
